Test suite to validate Hadoop basic specifications
==================================================

The test suite is intended to be used as a validation tool to make sure that a
Hadoop stack derived from Apache Bigtop is still compliant with it. The
minimalistic way of doing so would be to guarantee compatibility of the
environment, binaries layouts, certain configuration parameters, and so on.

Validation test suite for the specs is vaguely based on Apache Bigtop iTest and
consists of two essential parts: a configuration file, communicating the 
functional commands and expected outcome(s) of it; and the test driver to run
the commands and compare the results.
 
Running the tests
=================

Tests could be executed by running the following command 
```
  gradle :bigtop-tests:smoke-tests:odpi-runtime:test -Psmoke.tests --info
```
