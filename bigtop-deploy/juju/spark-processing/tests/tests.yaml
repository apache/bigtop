# exclude tests that are unrelated to bigtop. the exclusion of spark might
# look weird here, but for this bundle, we only care that spark is good in
# HA mode (covered by this bundle when we invoke the spark smoke-test). the
# typical spark tests will test spark once in standalone and twice more in
# various HA modes. that takes forever, so leave those heavy tests for the
# hadoop-spark bundle. let's go fast on this one.
