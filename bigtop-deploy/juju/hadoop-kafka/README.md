# Overview

The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the
distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers
using a simple programming model.

Hadoop is designed to scale from a few servers to thousands of machines,
each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware
to deliver high-availability, Hadoop can detect and handle failures at the
application layer. This provides a highly-available service on top of a cluster
of machines, each of which may be prone to failure.

Apache Kafka is an open-source message broker project developed by the Apache
Software Foundation written in Scala. The project aims to provide a unified,
high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. Learn
more at [kafka.apache.org][].

This bundle provides a complete deployment of Hadoop and Kafka components from
[Apache Bigtop][] that perform distributed data processing at scale. Ganglia
and rsyslog applications are also provided to monitor cluster health and syslog
activity.

## Bundle Composition

The applications that comprise this bundle are spread across 9 units as
follows:

  * NameNode (HDFS)
  * ResourceManager (YARN)
    * Colocated on the NameNode unit
  * Slave (DataNode and NodeManager)
    * 3 separate units
  * Kafka
  * Flume-Kafka
    * Colocated on the Kafka unit
  * Zookeeper
    * 3 separate units
  * Client (Hadoop endpoint)
  * Plugin (Facilitates communication with the Hadoop cluster)
    * Colocated on the Client unit
  * Flume-HDFS
    * Colocated on the Client unit
  * Ganglia (Web interface for monitoring cluster metrics)
    * Colocated on the Client unit
  * Rsyslog (Aggregate cluster syslog events in a single location)
    * Colocated on the Client unit

The Flume-HDFS unit provides an Apache Flume agent featuring an Avro source,
memory channel, and HDFS sink. This agent supports a relation with the
Flume-Kafka charm (apache-flume-kafka) to ingest messages published to a given
Kafka topic into HDFS.

Deploying this bundle results in a fully configured Apache Bigtop
cluster on any supported cloud, which can be scaled to meet workload
demands.


# Deploying

A working Juju installation is assumed to be present. If Juju is not yet set
up, please follow the [getting-started][] instructions prior to deploying this
bundle.

> **Note**: This bundle requires hardware resources that may exceed limits
of Free-tier or Trial accounts on some clouds. To deploy to these
environments, modify a local copy of [bundle.yaml][] to set
`services: 'X': num_units: 1` and `machines: 'X': constraints: mem=3G` as
needed to satisfy account limits.

Deploy this bundle from the Juju charm store with the `juju deploy` command:

    juju deploy hadoop-kafka

> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version
of Juju, use [juju-quickstart][] with the following syntax: `juju quickstart
hadoop-kafka`.

Alternatively, deploy a locally modified `bundle.yaml` with:

    juju deploy /path/to/bundle.yaml

> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version
of Juju, use [juju-quickstart][] with the following syntax: `juju quickstart
/path/to/bundle.yaml`.

The charms in this bundle can also be built from their source layers in the
[Bigtop charm repository][].  See the [Bigtop charm README][] for instructions
on building and deploying these charms locally.

## Network-Restricted Environments
Charms can be deployed in environments with limited network access. To deploy
in this environment, configure a Juju model with appropriate proxy and/or
mirror options. See [Configuring Models][] for more information.

# Configuring

The default Kafka topic where messages are published is unset. Set this to
an existing Kafka topic as follows:

    juju config flume-kafka kafka_topic='<topic_name>'

If no existing topic is available, create and verify a new topic with:

    juju run-action kafka/0 create-topic topic=<topic_name> \
     partitions=1 replication=1
    juju show-action-output <id>  # <-- id from above command

Once the Flume agents start, messages will start flowing into
HDFS in year-month-day directories here: `/user/flume/flume-kafka/%y-%m-%d`.


# Verifying

## Status
The applications that make up this bundle provide status messages to indicate
when they are ready:

    juju status

This is particularly useful when combined with `watch` to track the on-going
progress of the deployment:

    watch -n 2 juju status

The message for each unit will provide information about that unit's state.
Once they all indicate that they are ready, perform application smoke tests
to verify that the bundle is working as expected.

## Smoke Test
The charms for each core component (namenode, resourcemanager, slave, kafka,
and zookeeper) provide a `smoke-test` action that can be used to verify the
application is functioning as expected. Note that the 'slave' component runs
extensive tests provided by Apache Bigtop and may take up to 30 minutes to
complete. Run the smoke-test actions as follows:

    juju run-action namenode/0 smoke-test
    juju run-action resourcemanager/0 smoke-test
    juju run-action slave/0 smoke-test
    juju run-action kafka/0 smoke-test
    juju run-action zookeeper/0 smoke-test

> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version
of Juju, the syntax is `juju action do <application>/0 smoke-test`.

Watch the progress of the smoke test actions with:

    watch -n 2 juju show-action-status

> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version
of Juju, the syntax is `juju action status`.

Eventually, all of the actions should settle to `status: completed`.  If
any report `status: failed`, that application is not working as expected. Get
more information about a specific smoke test with:

    juju show-action-output <action-id>

> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version
of Juju, the syntax is `juju action fetch <action-id>`.

## Utilities
Applications in this bundle include command line and web utilities that
can be used to verify information about the cluster.

From the command line, show the HDFS dfsadmin report and view the current list
of YARN NodeManager units with the following:

    juju run --application namenode "su hdfs -c 'hdfs dfsadmin -report'"
    juju run --application resourcemanager "su yarn -c 'yarn node -list'"

Show the list of Zookeeper nodes with the following:

    juju run --unit zookeeper/0 'echo "ls /" | /usr/lib/zookeeper/bin/zkCli.sh'

To access the HDFS web console, find the `PUBLIC-ADDRESS` of the namenode
application and expose it:

    juju status namenode
    juju expose namenode

The web interface will be available at the following URL:

    http://NAMENODE_PUBLIC_IP:50070

Similarly, to access the Resource Manager web consoles, find the
`PUBLIC-ADDRESS` of the resourcemanager application and expose it:

    juju status resourcemanager
    juju expose resourcemanager

The YARN and Job History web interfaces will be available at the following URLs:

    http://RESOURCEMANAGER_PUBLIC_IP:8088
    http://RESOURCEMANAGER_PUBLIC_IP:19888


# Monitoring

This bundle includes Ganglia for system-level monitoring of the namenode,
resourcemanager, slave, kafka, and zookeeper units. Metrics are sent to a
centralized ganglia unit for easy viewing in a browser. To view the ganglia web
interface, find the `PUBLIC-ADDRESS` of the Ganglia application and expose it:

    juju status ganglia
    juju expose ganglia

The web interface will be available at:

    http://GANGLIA_PUBLIC_IP/ganglia


# Logging

This bundle includes rsyslog to collect syslog data from the namenode,
resourcemanager, slave, kafka, and zookeeper units. These logs are sent to a
centralized rsyslog unit for easy syslog analysis. One method of viewing this
log data is to simply cat syslog from the rsyslog unit:

    juju run --unit rsyslog/0 'sudo cat /var/log/syslog'

Logs may also be forwarded to an external rsyslog processing service. See
the *Forwarding logs to a system outside of the Juju environment* section of
the [rsyslog README](https://jujucharms.com/rsyslog/) for more information.


# Benchmarking

The `resourcemanager` charm in this bundle provide several benchmarks to gauge
the performance of the Hadoop cluster. Each benchmark is an action that can be
run with `juju run-action`:

    $ juju actions resourcemanager
    ACTION      DESCRIPTION
    mrbench     Mapreduce benchmark for small jobs
    nnbench     Load test the NameNode hardware and configuration
    smoke-test  Run an Apache Bigtop smoke test.
    teragen     Generate data with teragen
    terasort    Runs teragen to generate sample data, and then runs terasort to sort that data
    testdfsio   DFS IO Testing

# Scaling

By default, three Hadoop slave, one Kafka, and three zookeeper units are
deployed with this bundle. Scaling these applications is as simple as adding
more units. To add one unit:

    juju add-unit kafka
    juju add-unit slave
    juju add-unit zookeeper

Multiple units may be added at once.  For example, add four more slave units:

    juju add-unit -n4 slave
