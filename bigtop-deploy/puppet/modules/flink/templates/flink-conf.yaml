# Configuration values managed by puppet:
jobmanager.rpc.address: <%= @jobmanager_host %>
jobmanager.rpc.port: <%= @jobmanager_port %>
jobmanager.web.port: <%= @ui_port %>

<% if defined?(storage_dirs) %>
taskmanager.tmp.dirs: <%= @storage_dirs.join(":") %>
<% end %>

# Starting from Flink v1.5, there is a rewrite of Flink’s deployment and process
# model (internally known as FLIP-6). A new option 'mode' was introduced to
# indicate which executions to use. However, the way Bigtop puppet deploys
# 'flink-jobmanager' and 'flink-taskmanager', ie. calling 'flink-daemon.sh 
# jobmanager' and 'flink-daemon.sh taskmanager', is legacy. Without setting
# mode to 'legacy', flink's built-in exmaples fail with error
# "JobSubmissionException: Failed to submit JobGraph"
mode: legacy

# For performance reasons its highly recommended to allocate as much memory to the
# Flink TaskManager as possible by setting 'taskmanager.heap.mb'.
