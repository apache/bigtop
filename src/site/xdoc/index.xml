				Bigtop is an Apache Foundation project for Infrastructure Engineers and Data Scientists looking for comprehensive packaging, testing, and configuration of the leading open source big data components.
			</b>
				Bigtop supports a wide range of components/projects, including, but not limited to, Hadoop, HBase and Spark.

			<subsection name="Continuous Integration"></subsection>
			<p>
				Apache Bigtop uses Jenkins for continuous integration testing (you can learn more about Jenkins
				<a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">here</a>
				).
				There is a Jenkins server currently running for the project:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="https://ci.bigtop.apache.org/">https://ci.bigtop.apache.org/</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The Apache Jenkins server runs the "Bigtop-trunk" job whenever code is committed to the trunk branch, which in turn
				runs several test jobs.
			</p>
			<p>
				In each branch there is a job to build each component, a job to run package tests and a job to build package
				repositories.
