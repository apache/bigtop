Description: reliable, scalable, and manageable distributed data collection application
 Flume is a reliable, scalable, and manageable distributed data collection
 application for collecting data such as logs and delivering it to data stores
 such as Hadoop's HDFS.  It can efficiently collect, aggregate, and move large
 amounts of log data.  It has a simple, but flexible, architecture based on
 streaming data flows.  It is robust and fault tolerant with tunable reliability
 mechanisms and many failover and recovery mechanisms.  The system is centrally
 managed and allows for intelligent dynamic management.  It uses a simple
 extensible data model that allows for online analytic applications.
