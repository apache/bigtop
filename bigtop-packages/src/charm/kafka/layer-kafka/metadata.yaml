  Fast
  A single Kafka broker can handle hundreds of megabytes of reads and writes per
  second from thousands of clients.

  Scalable
  Kafka is designed to allow a single cluster to serve as the central data
  backbone for a large organization. It can be elastically and transparently
  expanded without downtime. Data streams are partitioned and spread over a
  cluster of machines to allow data streams larger than the capability of any
  single machine and to allow clusters of co-ordinated consumers.

  Durable
  Messages are persisted on disk and replicated within the cluster to prevent
  data loss. Each broker can handle terabytes of messages without performance
  impact.

  Distributed by Design
  Kafka has a modern cluster-centric design that offers strong durability and
  fault-tolerance guarantees.
