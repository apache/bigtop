        Apache Bigtop release version. The default, '1.2.1' will use the
        current GA release for all hiera data, puppet recipes,
        and installable packages. Set this to 'master' to use the latest
        upstream bits.
  network_interface:
    default: ""
    type: string
    description: |
      Network interface to bind Kafka to. Defaults to accepting
      connections on all interfaces. Accepts either the name of an
      interface (e.g., 'eth0'), or a CIDR range. If the latter, we\'ll
      bind to the first interface that we find with an IP address in
      that range.
