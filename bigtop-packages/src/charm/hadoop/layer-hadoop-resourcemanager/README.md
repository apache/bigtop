# Overview

The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the
distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers
using a simple programming model.

This charm deploys the ResourceManager component of the [Apache Bigtop][]
platform to provide YARN master resources.

[Apache Bigtop]: http://bigtop.apache.org/


# Deploying

A working Juju installation is assumed to be present. If Juju is not yet set
up, please follow the [getting-started][] instructions prior to deploying this
charm.

This charm is intended to be deployed via one of the [apache bigtop bundles][].
For example:

    juju deploy hadoop-processing

> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version
of Juju, use [juju-quickstart][] with the following syntax: `juju quickstart
hadoop-processing`.

This will deploy an Apache Bigtop cluster with this charm acting as the
ResourceManager. More information about this deployment can be found in the
[bundle readme](https://jujucharms.com/hadoop-processing/).

## Network-Restricted Environments
Charms can be deployed in environments with limited network access. To deploy
in this environment, configure a Juju model with appropriate proxy and/or
mirror options. See [Configuring Models][] for more information.

# Verifying

## Status
Apache Bigtop charms provide extended status reporting to indicate when they
are ready:

    juju status

This is particularly useful when combined with `watch` to track the on-going
progress of the deployment:

    watch -n 2 juju status

The message column will provide information about a given unit's state.
This charm is ready for use once the status message indicates that it is
ready with nodemanagers.

## Smoke Test
This charm provides a `smoke-test` action that can be used to verify the
application is functioning as expected. This action executes the 'yarn'
smoke tests provided by Apache Bigtop and may take up to
10 minutes to complete. Run the action as follows:

    juju run-action resourcemanager/0 smoke-test

> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version
of Juju, the syntax is `juju action do resourcemanager/0 smoke-test`.

Watch the progress of the smoke test actions with:

    watch -n 2 juju show-action-status

> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version
of Juju, the syntax is `juju action status`.

Eventually, the action should settle to `status: completed`.  If it
reports `status: failed`, the application is not working as expected. Get
more information about a specific smoke test with:

    juju show-action-output <action-id>

> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version
of Juju, the syntax is `juju action fetch <action-id>`.

## Utilities
This charm includes Hadoop command line and web utilities that can be used
to verify information about the cluster.

Show the running nodes on the command line with the following:

    juju run --application resourcemanager "su yarn -c 'yarn node -list'"

To access the Resource Manager web consoles, find the `PUBLIC-ADDRESS` of the
resourcemanager application and expose it:

    juju status resourcemanager
    juju expose resourcemanager

The YARN and Job History web interfaces will be available at the following URLs:

    http://RESOURCEMANAGER_PUBLIC_IP:8088
    http://RESOURCEMANAGER_PUBLIC_IP:19888


# Benchmarking

This charm provides several benchmarks to gauge the performance of the
cluster. Each benchmark is an action that can be run with `juju run-action`:

    $ juju actions resourcemanager
    ACTION      DESCRIPTION
    mrbench     Mapreduce benchmark for small jobs
    nnbench     Load test the NameNode hardware and configuration
    smoke-test  Run an Apache Bigtop smoke test.
    teragen     Generate data with teragen
    terasort    Runs teragen to generate sample data, and then runs terasort to sort that data
    testdfsio   DFS IO Testing

    $ juju run-action resourcemanager/0 nnbench
    Action queued with id: 55887b40-116c-4020-8b35-1e28a54cc622
