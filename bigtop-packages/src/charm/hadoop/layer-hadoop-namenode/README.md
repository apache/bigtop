## Overview

The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the
distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers
using a simple programming model.

This charm deploys the NameNode component of the Apache Bigtop platform
to provide HDFS master resources.


## Usage

This charm is intended to be deployed via one of the
[apache bigtop bundles](https://jujucharms.com/u/bigdata-dev/#bundles).
For example:

    juju deploy hadoop-processing

> Note: With Juju versions < 2.0, you will need to use [juju-deployer][] to
deploy the bundle.

This will deploy the Apache Bigtop platform with a workload node
preconfigured to work with the cluster.

You can also manually load and run map-reduce jobs via the plugin charm
included in the bundles linked above:

    juju scp my-job.jar plugin/0:
    juju ssh plugin/0
    hadoop jar my-job.jar


[juju-deployer]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/juju-deployer/


## Status and Smoke Test

Apache Bigtop charms provide extended status reporting to indicate when they
are ready:

    juju status --format=tabular

This is particularly useful when combined with `watch` to track the on-going
progress of the deployment:

    watch -n 0.5 juju status --format=tabular

The message for each unit will provide information about that unit's state.
Once they all indicate that they are ready, you can perform a "smoke test"
to verify HDFS or YARN services are working as expected. Trigger the
`smoke-test` action by:

    juju action do namenode/0 smoke-test
    juju action do resourcemanager/0 smoke-test

After a few seconds or so, you can check the results of the smoke test:

    juju action status

You will see `status: completed` if the smoke test was successful, or
`status: failed` if it was not.  You can get more information on why it failed
via:

    juju action fetch <action-id>


## Deploying in Network-Restricted Environments

Charms can be deployed in environments with limited network access. To deploy
in this environment, you will need a local mirror to serve required packages.


### Mirroring Packages

You can setup a local mirror for apt packages using squid-deb-proxy.
For instructions on configuring juju to use this, see the
[Juju Proxy Documentation](https://juju.ubuntu.com/docs/howto-proxies.html).
