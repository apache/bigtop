# Overview

The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the
distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers
using a simple programming model.

This charm deploys a combined slave node running the NodeManager
and DataNode components of the [Apache Bigtop][] platform
to provide YARN compute and HDFS storage resources.

[Apache Bigtop]: http://bigtop.apache.org/


# Deploying

A working Juju installation is assumed to be present. If Juju is not yet set
up, please follow the [getting-started][] instructions prior to deploying this
charm.

This charm is intended to be deployed via one of the [apache bigtop bundles][].
For example:

    juju deploy hadoop-processing

> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version
of Juju, use [juju-quickstart][] with the following syntax: `juju quickstart
hadoop-processing`.

This will deploy an Apache Bigtop cluster with 3 units of this charm acting as
the combined DataNode/NodeManager application. More information about this
deployment can be found in the [bundle readme](https://jujucharms.com/hadoop-processing/).

## Network-Restricted Environments
Charms can be deployed in environments with limited network access. To deploy
in this environment, configure a Juju model with appropriate proxy and/or
mirror options. See [Configuring Models][] for more information.

# Verifying

## Status
Apache Bigtop charms provide extended status reporting to indicate when they
are ready:

    juju status

This is particularly useful when combined with `watch` to track the on-going
progress of the deployment:

    watch -n 2 juju status

The message column will provide information about a given unit's state.
This charm is ready for use once the status message indicates that it is
ready as a datanode/nodemanager.

## Smoke Test
This charm provides a `smoke-test` action that can be used to verify the
application is functioning as expected. This action executes the 'hdfs'
and 'mapreduce' smoke tests provided by Apache Bigtop and may take up to
30 minutes to complete. Run the action as follows:

    juju run-action slave/0 smoke-test

> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version
of Juju, the syntax is `juju action do slave/0 smoke-test`.

Watch the progress of the smoke test actions with:

    watch -n 2 juju show-action-status

> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version
of Juju, the syntax is `juju action status`.

Eventually, the action should settle to `status: completed`.  If it
reports `status: failed`, the application is not working as expected. Get
more information about a specific smoke test with:

    juju show-action-output <action-id>

> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version
of Juju, the syntax is `juju action fetch <action-id>`.


# Scaling

To scale the cluster compute and storage capabilities, simply add more
slave units. To add one unit:

    juju add-unit slave

Multiple units may be added at once.  For example, add four more slave units:

    juju add-unit -n4 slave
