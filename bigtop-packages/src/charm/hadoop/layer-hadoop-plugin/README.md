# Overview

The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the
distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers
using a simple programming model.

This charm facilitates communication between Hadoop components of an
[Apache Bigtop][] cluster and workload applications.

[Apache Bigtop]: http://bigtop.apache.org/


# Deploying

This charm requires Juju 2.0 or greater. If Juju is not yet set up, please
follow the [getting-started][] instructions prior to deploying this charm.

This charm is intended to be deployed via one of the [apache bigtop bundles][].
For example:

    juju deploy hadoop-processing

This will deploy an Apache Bigtop cluster with a client unit preconfigured to
work with the cluster. More information about this deployment can be found in the
[bundle readme](https://jujucharms.com/hadoop-processing/).

## Network-Restricted Environments
Charms can be deployed in environments with limited network access. To deploy
in this environment, configure a Juju model with appropriate proxy and/or
mirror options. See [Configuring Models][] for more information.

# Verifying

## Status
Apache Bigtop charms provide extended status reporting to indicate when they
are ready:

    juju status

This is particularly useful when combined with `watch` to track the on-going
progress of the deployment:

    watch -n 2 juju status

The message column will provide information about a given unit's state.
This charm is ready for use once the status message indicates that it is
ready with hdfs and/or yarn.

## Smoke Test
This charm provides a `smoke-test` action that can be used to verify the
application is functioning as expected. Run the action as follows:

    juju run-action plugin/0 smoke-test

Watch the progress of the smoke test actions with:

    watch -n 2 juju show-action-status

Eventually, the action should settle to `status: completed`.  If it
reports `status: failed`, the application is not working as expected. Get
more information about a specific smoke test with:

    juju show-action-output <action-id>

## Utilities
This charm includes Hadoop command line utilities that can be used
to verify information about the cluster.

Show the dfsadmin report on the command line with the following:

    juju run --application plugin "su hdfs -c 'hdfs dfsadmin -report'"


# Issues

Apache Bigtop tracks issues using JIRA (Apache account required). File an
issue for this charm at:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa

Ensure `Bigtop` is selected as the project. Typically, charm issues are filed
in the `deployment` component with the latest stable release selected as the
affected version. Any uncertain fields may be left blank.
