smoke-test:
    description: |
      Verify the Bigtop Pig service is working by executing a smoke test. If
      pig is in 'local' mode, the smoke test will execute a local /etc/passwd
      analysis job. If pig is in 'mapreduce' mode, the Bigtop smoke test will
      be executed, which exercises Pig with HDFS and MapReduce.
