#
# Rolling restart -- helpers and handlers
#
# When we add or remove a Zookeeper peer, Zookeeper needs to perform a
# rolling restart of all of its peers, restarting the Zookeeper
# "leader" last.
#
# The following functions accomplish this. Here's how they all fit together:
#
# (As you read, keep in mind that one node functions as the "leader"
# in the context of Juju, and one node functions as the "leader" in
# the context of Zookeeper; these nodes may or may not be the same.)
#
# 0. Whenever the Zookeeper server starts, it attempts to determine
#    whether it is the Zookeeper leader. If so, it sets a flag on the
#    Juju peer relation data.
#
# 1. When a node is added or remove from the cluster, the Juju leader
#    runs `check_cluster`, and generates a "restart queue" comprising
#    nodes in the cluster, with the Zookeeper lead node sorted last in
#    the queue. It also sets a nonce, to identify this restart queue
#    uniquely, and thus handle the situation where another node is
#    added or restarted while we're still reacting to the first node's
#    addition or removal. The leader drops the queue and nonce into
#    the leadership data as "restart_queue" and "restart_nonce",
#    respectively.
#
# 2. When any node detects a leadership.changed.restart_queue event,
#    it runs `restart_for_quorum`, which is a noop unless the node's
#    private address is the first element of the restart queue. In
#    that case, if the node is the Juju leader, it will restart, then
#    remove itself from the restart queue, triggering another
#    leadership.changed.restart_queue event. If the node isn't the
#    Juju leader, it will restart itself, then run `inform_restart`.
#
# 3. `inform_restart` will create a relation data changed event, which
#    triggers `update_restart_queue` to run on the leader. This method
#    will update the restart_queue, clearing any nodes that have
#    restarted for the current nonce, and looping us back to step 2.
#
# 4. Once all the nodes have restarted, we should be in the following state:
#
#    * All nodes have an updated Zookeeper server running with the new
#    * peer data.
#
#    * The Zookeeper leader has restarted last, which should help
#      prevent orphaned jobs, per the Zookeeper docs.
#
#    * peers still have zkpeer.restarted.<nonce> set on their relation
#      data. This is okay, as we will generate a new nonce next time,
#      and the data is small.
#
# Edge cases and potential bugs:
#
# 1. Juju leader changes in the middle of a restart: this gets a
#    little bit dicey, but it should work. The new leader should run
#    `check_cluster_departed`, and start a new restart_queue.
#
