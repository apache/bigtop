description: >
  Apache ZooKeeper is a centralized, reliable application for maintaining
  configuration information, naming, synchronization, and group services. All
  of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed
  applications. In order to install and configure Apache HBase and other Hadoop
  ecosystem components, you need ZooKeeper.

  This charm provides version 3.4.6 of the ZooKeeper application from Apache
  Bigtop.
