# Overview

HBase is the Hadoop database. Think of it as a distributed, scalable Big Data
store.

Use HBase when you need random, realtime read/write access to your Big Data.
This project's goal is the hosting of very large tables -- billions of rows X
millions of columns -- atop clusters of commodity hardware. Learn more at
[hbase.apache.org][].

This charm deploys version 1.1.9 of the HBase master and regionserver
components from [Apache Bigtop][].

# Deploying

This charm requires Juju 2.0 or greater. If Juju is not yet set up, please
follow the [getting-started][] instructions prior to deploying this charm.

An HBase deployment consists of HBase masters and HBase RegionServers.
In a distributed HBase environment, one master and one regionserver are
deployed on each unit. HBase ensures that only one master is active with
the rest in standby mode in case the active master fails.

Because HBase requires HDFS, this charm is recommended to be deployed as part
of the `hadoop-hbase` bundle:

    juju deploy hadoop-hbase

This will deploy an Apache Bigtop Hadoop cluster with 3 HBase units. More
information about this deployment can be found in the
[bundle readme](https://jujucharms.com/hadoop-hbase/).

This charm also supports the Thrift client API for HBase. Thrift is both
cross-platform and more lightweight than REST for many operations.

## Network-Restricted Environments
Charms can be deployed in environments with limited network access. To deploy
in this environment, configure a Juju model with appropriate proxy and/or
mirror options. See [Configuring Models][] for more information.

# Verifying

## Status
Apache Bigtop charms provide extended status reporting to indicate when they
are ready:

    juju status

This is particularly useful when combined with `watch` to track the on-going
progress of the deployment:

    watch -n 2 juju status

The message column will provide information about a given unit's state.
This charm is ready for use once the status message indicates that it is
ready.

## Smoke Test
This charm provides a `smoke-test` action that can be used to verify the
application is functioning as expected. Run the action as follows:

    juju run-action hbase/0 smoke-test

Watch the progress of the smoke test actions with:

    watch -n 2 juju show-action-status

Eventually, the action should settle to `status: completed`.  If it
reports `status: failed`, the application is not working as expected. Get
more information about a specific smoke test with:

    juju show-action-output <action-id>

## HBase web UI
HBase provides a web console that can be used to verify information about
the cluster. To access it, find the `PUBLIC-ADDRESS` of any hbase unit and
expose the application:

    juju status hbase
    juju expose hbase

The web interface will be available at the following URL:

    http://HBASE_PUBLIC_IP:60010


# Using

Once the deployment has been verified, there are a number of actions available
in this charm.

Run a performance test:

    juju run-action hbase/0 perf-test
    juju show-action-output <id>  # <-- id from above command

Run a smoke test (as described in the above **Verifying** section):

    juju run-action hbase/0 smoke-test
    juju show-action-output <id>  # <-- id from above command

Start/Stop/Restart all HBase services on a unit:

    juju run-action hbase/0 [start|stop|restart]
    juju show-action-output <id>  # <-- id from above command


Start/Stop the HBase Master service on a unit:

    juju run-action hbase/0 [start|stop]-hbase-master
    juju show-action-output <id>  # <-- id from above command

Start/Stop the HBase RegionServer and Thrift services on a unit:

    juju run-action hbase/0 [start|stop]-hbase-regionserver
    juju show-action-output <id>  # <-- id from above command


# Limitations

Restarting an HBase deployment is potentially disruptive. Be aware that the
following events will cause a restart:

- Zookeeper units joining or departing the quorum.
- Upgrading the hbase charm.


# Issues

Apache Bigtop tracks issues using JIRA (Apache account required). File an
issue for this charm at:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa

Ensure `Bigtop` is selected as the project. Typically, charm issues are filed
in the `deployment` component with the latest stable release selected as the
affected version. Any uncertain fields may be left blank.
