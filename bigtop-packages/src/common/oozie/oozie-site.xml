        <description>
            Comma separated AUTHORITY=HADOOP_CONF_DIR, where AUTHORITY is the HOST:PORT of
            the Hadoop service (JobTracker, YARN, HDFS). The wildcard '*' configuration is
            used when there is no exact match for an authority. The HADOOP_CONF_DIR contains
            the relevant Hadoop *-site.xml files. If the path is relative is looked within
            the Oozie configuration directory; though the path can be absolute (i.e. to point
            to Hadoop client conf/ directories in the local filesystem.

            Comma separated AUTHORITY=SPARK_CONF_DIR, where AUTHORITY is the HOST:PORT of 
            the ResourceManager of a YARN cluster. The wildcard '*' configuration is used when 
            there is no exact match for an authority. The SPARK_CONF_DIR contains the relevant 
            spark-defaults.conf properties file. If the path is relative is looked within the 
            Oozie configuration directory; though the path can be absolute. 
            This is only used when the Spark master is set to either "yarn-client" or "yarn-cluster".
