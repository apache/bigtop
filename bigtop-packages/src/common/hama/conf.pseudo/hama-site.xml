		<description>Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper Quorum.
			For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
			By default this is set to localhost for local and pseudo-distributed modes
			of operation. For a fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full
			list of ZooKeeper quorum servers. If HAMA_MANAGES_ZK is set in hama-env.sh
			this is the list of servers which we will start/stop zookeeper on.
