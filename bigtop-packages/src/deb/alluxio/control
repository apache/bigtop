Description: Reliable file sharing at memory speed across cluster frameworks
 Alluxio is a fault tolerant distributed file system
 enabling reliable file sharing at memory-speed
 across cluster frameworks, such as Spark and MapReduce.
 It achieves high performance by leveraging lineage
 information and using memory aggressively.
 Alluxio caches working set files in memory, and
 enables different jobs/queries and frameworks to
 access cached files at memory speed. Thus, Alluxio
 avoids going to disk to load data-sets that
 are frequently read.
