Description: Hadoop is a software platform for processing vast amounts of data
 Hadoop is a software platform that lets one easily write and
 run applications that process vast amounts of data.
 .
 Here's what makes Hadoop especially useful:
 * Scalable: Hadoop can reliably store and process petabytes.
 * Economical: It distributes the data and processing across clusters
               of commonly available computers. These clusters can number
               into the thousands of nodes.
 * Efficient: By distributing the data, Hadoop can process it in parallel
              on the nodes where the data is located. This makes it
              extremely rapid.
 * Reliable: Hadoop automatically maintains multiple copies of data and
             automatically redeploys computing tasks based on failures.
 .
 Hadoop implements MapReduce, using the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
 MapReduce divides applications into many small blocks of work. HDFS creates
 multiple replicas of data blocks for reliability, placing them on compute
 nodes around the cluster. MapReduce can then process the data where it is
 located.

Description: The Hadoop Distributed File System
 Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is the primary storage system used by 
 Hadoop applications. HDFS creates multiple replicas of data blocks and distributes 
 them on compute nodes throughout a cluster to enable reliable, extremely rapid 
 computations.

Description: The Hadoop NextGen MapReduce (YARN)
 YARN (Hadoop NextGen MapReduce) is a general purpose data-computation framework.
 The fundamental idea of YARN is to split up the two major functionalities of the 
 JobTracker, resource management and job scheduling/monitoring, into separate daemons:
 ResourceManager and NodeManager.
 .
 The ResourceManager is the ultimate authority that arbitrates resources among all 
 the applications in the system. The NodeManager is a per-node slave managing allocation
 of computational resources on a single node. Both work in support of per-application 
 ApplicationMaster (AM).
 .
 An ApplicationMaster is, in effect, a framework specific library and is tasked with 
 negotiating resources from the ResourceManager and working with the NodeManager(s) to 
 execute and monitor the tasks.
