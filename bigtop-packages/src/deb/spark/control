Description: Lightning-Fast Cluster Computing
 Spark is a MapReduce-like cluster computing framework designed to support
 low-latency iterative jobs and interactive use from an interpreter. It is
 written in Scala, a high-level language for the JVM, and exposes a clean 
 language-integrated syntax that makes it easy to write parallel jobs. 
 Spark runs on top of the Apache Mesos cluster manager.
