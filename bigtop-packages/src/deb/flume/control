Package: flume
Architecture: all
Depends: adduser, hadoop, hadoop-hdfs, bigtop-utils (>= 0.7)
Description: Flume is a reliable, scalable, and manageable distributed log collection application for collecting data such as logs and delivering it to data stores such as Hadoop's HDFS.
 Flume is a reliable, scalable, and manageable distributed data 
 collection application for collecting data such as logs and delivering it 
 to data stores such as Hadoop's HDFS.  It can efficiently collect, 
 aggregate, and move large amounts of log data.  It has a simple, 
 but flexible, architecture based on streaming data flows.  It is 
 robust and fault tolerant with tunable reliability mechanisms and many 
 failover and recovery mechanisms.  The system is centrally managed and 
 allows for intelligent dynamic management. It uses a simple extensible 
 data model that allows for online analytic applications.
