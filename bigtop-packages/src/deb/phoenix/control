Description: Phoenix is a SQL skin over HBase and client-embedded JDBC driver.
 Phoenix is a SQL skin over HBase, delivered as a client-embedded JDBC driver.
 The Phoenix query engine transforms an SQL query into one or more HBase scans,
 and orchestrates their execution to produce standard JDBC result sets. Direct
 use of the HBase API, along with coprocessors and custom filters, results in
 performance on the order of milliseconds for small queries, or seconds for
 tens of millions of rows. Applications interact with Phoenix through a
 standard JDBC interface; all the usual interfaces are supported.
