Description: A collection of user-defined functions for Hadoop and Pig.
 DataFu is a collection of user-defined functions for working with large-scale 
 data in Hadoop and Pig. This library was born out of the need for a stable, 
 well-tested library of UDFs for data mining and statistics. It is used 
 at LinkedIn in many of our off-line workflows for data derived products like 
 "People You May Know" and "Skills". 
 .
 It contains functions for: PageRank, Quantiles (median), variance, Sessionization, 
 Convenience bag functions (e.g., set operations, enumerating bags, etc), 
 Convenience utility functions (e.g., assertions, easier writing of EvalFuncs)
 and more...
