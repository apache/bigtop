Description: Giraph is a BSP inspired graph processing platform that runs on Hadoop
 Giraph implements a graph processing platform to run large scale algorithms 
 (such as page rank, shared connections, personalization-based popularity, etc.)
 on top of Hadoop infrastructure. Giraph builds upon the graph-oriented nature 
 of Pregel but additionally adds fault-tolerance to the coordinator process with 
 the use of ZooKeeper as its centralized coordination service.
