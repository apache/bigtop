Description: A set of Java libraries for scalable machine learning.
 Mahout's goal is to build scalable machine learning libraries. 
 With scalable we mean:
 .
 Scalable to reasonably large data sets. Our core algorithms for clustering,
 classfication and batch based collaborative filtering are implemented on top of
 Apache Hadoop using the map/reduce paradigm. However we do not restrict
 contributions to Hadoop based implementations: Contributions that run on a
 single node or on a non-Hadoop cluster are welcome as well. The core libraries
 are highly optimized to allow for good performance also for non-distributed
 algorithms.
 Scalable to support your business case. Mahout is distributed under a 
 commercially friendly Apache Software license.
 Scalable community. The goal of Mahout is to build a vibrant, responsive,
 diverse community to facilitate discussions not only on the project itself but
 also on potential use cases. Come to the mailing lists to find out more.
