Description: Data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop
 Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop that provides
 tools to enable easy data summarization, adhoc querying and analysis of large
 datasets data stored in Hadoop files. It provides a mechanism to put structure
 on this data and it also provides a simple query language called Hive QL which
 is based on SQL and which enables users familiar with SQL to query this data.
 At the same time, this language also allows traditional map/reduce programmers
 to be able to plug in their custom mappers and reducers to do more
 sophisticated analysis which may not be supported by the built-in
 capabilities of the language.
